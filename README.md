“Volumetric Analysis using Computer Vision”


The problem is to determine volume of an object (for example a tennis ball, golf ball etc.) from different perspectives of the same object captured from a mobile camera.
Each image captured should have a ruler ( our usual calibrated ruler, of 15cm) which is placed in horizontal or vertical position in the image so that the ruler and its calibration are clearly visible.
